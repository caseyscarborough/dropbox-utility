The application is in the\r\nbeginning stages of development, and more features are planned.\r\n\r\nThe current features are listed below:\r\n\r\n* Display user information\r\n* Upload single files\r\n* List directory contents\r\n* Store authentication\r\n* Delete authentication\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe following is the usage instructions for the application.\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage: dropbox-utility [options]\r\n    -i, --info                       Displays user information\r\n    -u, --upload FILENAME            Specifies filename to upload\r\n    -l, --list [PATH]                Lists contents of PATH specified\r\n                                     Uses root directory if PATH not given.\r\n    -d                               Removes authentication file. Will require\r\n                                     re-authentication on next application start\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to use the application, you can install it by running the following command from the command\r\nline on your machine.\r\n```\r\ngem install dropbox-utility\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the installation, you can then run the application from anywhere in the command line:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndropbox-utility [options]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to contribute, you can begin by cloning the repository or\r\n[downloading the zip archive](https://github.com/caseyscarborough/dropbox-utility/archive/master.zip) and\r\nextracting it.\r\n\r\nFor the application to work, you must add your Dropbox Developer application key and secret to the file located at\r\n<code>lib/dropbox-utility/config.rb</code>, as well as the save location for your configuration file, shown below.\r\n```ruby\r\nAPP_KEY = 'your-app-key'\r\nAPP_SECRET = 'your-app-secret'\r\nACCESS_TYPE = :dropbox\r\nAUTH_FILE = Dir.home + '/.dropbox-utility'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you do not have an application key and secret, you can begin by going to [https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)\r\nand creating an app.\r\n\r\nAfter completing this, run <code>bundle install</code> and then the executable file located in the <code>bin</code> directory.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bundle install\r\n$ ruby bin/dropbox-utility [options]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first time you run the application, you will need to authenticate the application by clicking 'Allow' in\r\nthe browser window that appears. After that, your session will be saved in your user directory in a file named\r\n<code>.dropbox-utility</code>.\r\n\r\n## To-do\r\n\r\n* Add more features.\r\n* Possibly refactor to be more intuitive.\r\n* Create documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contribute to the application by following the steps below:\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5. Create new Pull Request\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
